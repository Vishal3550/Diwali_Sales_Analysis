# Diwali_Sales_Analysis_Using_Python

## Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of Diwali sales data to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in customer purchases. The analysis leverages Python and Jupyter Notebook to process and visualize data, enabling data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies and customer targeting.

## Files in the Repository
1. **Diwali_Sales_Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization steps.
2. **Diwali Sales Data.csv**: The dataset used for analysis, which includes information about sales transactions during the Diwali festival.
3. **Data Set**: [Data Set](https://github.com/Vishal3550/Diwali_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Diwali%20Sales%20Data.csv)

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer demographics, product categories, and sales performance.
- Visualizations to identify:
  - Top-performing product categories
  - Customer purchase behavior based on age, gender, and city tier
  - Seasonal trends and spikes in sales
- Insights and actionable recommendations for marketing campaigns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code execution and visualization.

## Prerequisites
1. Install Python (version 3.7 or higher).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diwali-sales-analysis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diwali_Sales_Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore the dataset and visualizations.

## Dataset Details
The `Diwali Sales Data.csv` contains the following columns:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (Male/Female)
- **Age Group**: Age group of the customer (e.g., 18-25, 26-35)
- **City Tier**: Tier of the city (1, 2, or 3)
- **Product Category**: Category of the purchased product
- **Amount**: Total purchase amount

## Insights and Key Findings
- High sales volumes are observed in Tier 1 cities.
- The age group 26-35 contributes the most to sales.
- Certain product categories perform exceptionally well during the Diwali season.

## Future Improvements
- Add predictive modeling to forecast sales trends.
- Enhance visualizations with interactive dashboards using libraries like Plotly or Dash.
- Integrate additional datasets to expand the scope of analysis.
